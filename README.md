RAP-FX
======

The Eclispe RAP JavaFX Client.

Please note that currently RAP does not (out of the box) support additional clients.
(see [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=404144]).

To get the client connected to an arbitrary RAP application, currently there is a
"workaround" required, which is more of a hack... Please see the files in the
org.rapfx.server.test plugins for a sample.
